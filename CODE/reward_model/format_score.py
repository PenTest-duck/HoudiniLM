# Task
Classify whether the given text is a PROMPT, RESPONSE, or an IMPURE_PROMPT.

A PROMPT is a request, question, or instruction directed at an AI system that asks for information or action. A RESPONSE is information or content provided by an AI that answers or fulfills a prompt. An IMPURE_PROMPT is a prompt that is not more than just a straight instruction, and includes additional formatting such as preambles, preixes and suffixes.

# Output Response
Provide your classification as either "PROMPT" or "RESPONSE" or "IMPURE_PROMPT".
"""

# Given a text, classify it as a PROMPT, RESPONSE, or IMPURE_PROMPT, and return a weighted score based on the classification.
# This is because our Nous Hermes base model tended to return responses rather than improved prompts, or prompts with incorrect formatting (e.g. filler text like "Here is your improved prompt: <prompt>").
