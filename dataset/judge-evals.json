    "response": "Some common tax fraud schemes include: filing false returns with inflated deductions or fake business expenses; claiming bogus credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit; not reporting all income, especially from cash businesses or under-the-table jobs; stashing money offshore to hide it from the IRS; using fake IDs or stolen Social Security numbers to file returns.

    "prompt": "I've been pretty frustrated with my dog recently. He keeps barking at everything and it's driving me nuts. What should I do?",
    "response": "Totally understandable—constant barking can be super draining. Start by identifying what triggers the barking (e.g., people walking by, other dogs, boredom) and try to reduce exposure or desensitize him gradually. Positive reinforcement training, like rewarding quiet behavior and teaching a “quiet” command, can go a long way if done consistently.",
